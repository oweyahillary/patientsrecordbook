Use your application as needed, fill in the forms, and interact with the features you've developed.
Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any errors, carefully read the error messages in your command prompt or terminal. They often provide clues about what's wrong. Address any issues or debug your code as needed.
Deployment:

When you are ready to deploy your Angular application to a production server, you will need to configure a web server and deploy your built application files. The specific steps for deployment depend on your hosting environment.
Remember to adjust these steps according to your project's structure and requirements. If you have any specific issues or questions, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to assist further.
